# K-Nearest-Neighbors--Basic

### How data collection and preparation are the foundation for trusted ML models
Step 1. Extract<br/>
    a. Features and target should not have null values<br/>
    b. Features should not be non-numeric<br/>
    c. Features should be of the type array or dataframe<br/>
    d. features should be in the form of rows and columns<br/>

Step 2. Split into training and testing sets<br/>
    e. Features should be on the same scale<br/>

Step 3. Train the model on trainig dataset

Step 4. Test the model on testing dataset

Step 5. predict on unlabeled dataset
